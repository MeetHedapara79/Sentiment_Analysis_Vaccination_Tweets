# Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets

## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to detect and classify tweets into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. Machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are employed to enhance the accuracy of sentiment classification.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into public opinions and thoughts regarding COVID-19 vaccines. By classifying tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, we can better understand the sentiment trends surrounding vaccine-related discussions on social media.

## Techniques and Tools
1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLP techniques are used to preprocess and analyze the textual data from tweets. This includes tasks such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and text vectorization.

2. **Sentiment Classification:** Machine learning algorithms, specifically Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine, are employed for sentiment classification. These models are trained on labeled data to accurately classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

3. **Data Collection:** Data Collected from Kaggle.

4. **Data Cleaning:** The collected data undergoes data cleaning to remove noise, duplicates, and irrelevant information.

5. **Data Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distribution of sentiments.
   
6. **Data Visualization:** Visualize the results using graphs, charts, or other visualization techniques to understand sentiment trends.

7. **Interpretation:** Interpret the findings to draw insights and conclusions about public sentiment regarding COVID-19 vaccines.

## Dependencies
- Python
- Libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for NLP and data analysis.
